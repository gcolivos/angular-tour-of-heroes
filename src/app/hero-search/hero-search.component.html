<!-- As the user types in the search box, a keyup event binding calls the component's search() method with the new search box value. -->

<!-- As expected, the *ngFor repeats hero objects.

Look closely and you'll see that the *ngFor iterates over a list called heroes$, not heroes.

<li *ngFor="let hero of heroes$ | async" >
The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.

The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async, which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe.

The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class. -->
